Hi, welcome to Mengyuan's home!

![](/images/photo.jpg)


Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/)(UoM), supervised by [Prof. Hujun Yin](Thttps://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/hujun.yin/), supported by the UoM-CSC Joint Scholarship. Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/) in 2016, and master's degree in Electronic and Communication Engineering from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) in 2019. From Novermber 2019 to July 2020, I worked as a research intern focusing on human activity grounding at [iLearn](https://ilearn.qd.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://en.sdu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Liqiang NIE](https://liqiangnie.github.io/). My research interests cover a wide range of deep learning related topics including imgae segmentation, semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation, information retrieval and remote sensing. Also, I serve as a reviewer for several top-tier journals such as [IEEE Sensors Journal](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7361) and [Remote Sensing](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing). For more about my academic backgroud, please refer to my [CV](https://academicpages.github.io/cv/) and [Publication](https://academicpages.github.io/publications/).  

Beyond research and work, I am also a wanderlust and amateur photographer and drone flyer. I have been to more than 20 countries, taken thousand of pictures and videos. Due to the pandemic of Covid-19, I spent most of time staying at home and fly my UAV to record the city of Manchester these days. If you are sharing the same hobbies with me, please drop me an email or follow my instagram, we can discuss more about journey and photographing.

**Abstract**<br>
We propose a video analysis system detecting activities in surveillance scenarioswhich wins Trecvid Activities in Extended Video (ActEV1) challenge 2019. Fordetecting and localizing surveillance events in videos, Argus employs a spatial-temporal activity proposal generation module facilitating object detection andtracking, followed by a sequential classification module to spatially and temporallylocalize persons and objects involved in the activity. We detail the design challengesand provide our insights and solutions in developing the state-of-the-art surveillancevideo analysis system. <br>
